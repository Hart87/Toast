Toast messages come from Android. They're subtle messages that appear briefly towards
the bottom of the screen and then go away a few seconds later.

# Installation

copy the Toast.swift file into your directory

# Use

```swift
var toast = Toast()

toast.Show(message: "üö® üçû First Toast üçû üö®", textColor: .white, backgroundColor: .blue, view: self.view)
```

The function takes 4 parameters:

`message: String` - The message you want to send. 

`textColor/backgroundColor:  UIColor` - The color of the text and the background respectively.
`view: UIView`  - The view you want the toast to appear in. The message will last for 4 seconds.

Feel free to use it in your apps. Hope you enjoy it. Spread the word.
